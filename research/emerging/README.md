## KEY FINDINGS FOR WORKSHOP DEVELOPMENT

### 🎯 Critical Patterns (Must Teach)

1. **Hierarchical Agent Architectures**
   - Planner → Worker → Judge pattern
   - Only pattern that scales (Cursor FastRender proven)
   - Workshop: Module 5 - Multi-Agent Foundations

2. **Subagent Specialization**
   - Modular agent teams with isolated contexts
   - Production-ready across Claude Code, Spring AI, Cursor
   - Workshop: Module 5 - Multi-Agent Foundations

3. **Git Worktree Isolation**
   - Parallel agent execution without conflicts
   - Standard for production orchestration
   - Workshop: Module 4 - Parallel Orchestration

4. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Clear specs = better AI output
   - AGENTS.md standard emerging
   - Workshop: Module 1 - Foundations

5. **Quality Guardrails**
   - Verification loops essential
   - 41% higher churn without oversight
   - Workshop: Module 2 - Quality & Verification

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

**Speed vs Quality Reality**:
- Marketing claims: 50-300% productivity
- Reality: 8-13% net improvement (Thoughtworks)
- 9% increase in bug rates (Google DORA 2025)
- 41% higher code churn (GitClear 2026)

**Professional Practice**:
- 72% of developers reject "vibe coding" (Stack Overflow 2025)
- Seniors use AI 2.5x more effectively than juniors
- Key: Control, don't vibe

**Production Failures**:
- Cursor browser: 3M lines, every commit failed
- Gas Town: Database down 2 days (agent erased passwords)
- Clear lesson: Autonomous ≠ unsupervised

### 🚀 Emerging Tools (2026)

**Production-Ready**:
- **Conductor** (macOS): Parallel agent orchestration
- **Vibe Kanban** (cross-platform): Visual orchestration UI
- **Claude Code Subagents**: Native multi-agent support
- **GitHub Copilot Agent**: Issue-driven autonomous coding

**Experimental/Educational**:
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Best for learning multi-agent concepts
- **Orchestral AI**: Multi-provider orchestration research
- **Ralph Loop Pattern**: Autonomous loops (use with guardrails)

**Standards**:
- **A2A Protocol**: Agent interoperability (Google/Microsoft supported)
- **AGENTS.md**: Agent-specific documentation (widely adopted)
- **Agent Skills**: Portable expertise packages (Vercel open spec)
