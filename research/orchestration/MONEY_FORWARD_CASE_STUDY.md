## 3. ADOPTION STRATEGY

### Phased Rollout Approach
1. **MEPAR Initiative**: Established internal AI productivity research group
2. **Rigorous Evaluation Process**:
   - Small group trials with structured feedback
   - Only tools with strong feedback advance to broader rollout
   - Public channels for knowledge sharing
3. **Bottom-Up Adoption**: 200+ engineers requested access after seeing trial results
4. **Organization-Wide Launch**: July rollout with Anthropic training workshop in August

### Integration with Development Workflow
- **CLI-Based Architecture**: Works with WebStorm, JetBrains IDEs, RubyMine, VS Code
- **PR Workflow Integration**: Custom template based on style guide
- **Automated Onboarding**: Interactive setup for frontend, backend, end-to-end repos

---

## 4. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES

### Productivity Metrics
- **7 hours/week saved** per engineer (internal survey)
- **70% reduction** in API endpoint implementation time
- **90%+ code acceptance rate** - engineers trust output without extensive review
- **1-week to 1-day** compression of new developer onboarding

### Quality Improvements
- **Elevated PR Quality**: Developers fix issues before human review
- **Reduced Reviewer Burden**: Human reviewers focus on architectural decisions
- **Cross-Language Understanding**: Understands full context across languages and repositories

### Organizational Impact
- **Essential Infrastructure**: Became indispensable tool after rollout
- **Most Active Channel**: Claude Code channel is company's most active AI-related channel
- **Cross-Regional Adoption**: Teams in Tokyo, Kansai, India, Vietnam

## 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### MCP Server Development
**Quote**: "I built Money Forward's entire MCP Server in three months using Claude Code. It implemented my plans and reviewed code—essentially acting as my only colleague on the project."
- **Developer**: Tamai Ayumi, Staff Software Engineer
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Team Size**: 1 (solo development)
- **Role**: Implementation partner and code reviewer

### Automated Onboarding System
**Quote**: "Claude Code's agentic capability transformed onboarding from frustration to enjoyment. What used to take a week now takes a day."
- **Developer**: Aaron Li, Staff Engineer
- **Command**: `/onboarding`
- **Scope**: Frontend, backend, end-to-end repository setup
- **Impact**: Saved countless hours for existing team members

### Internal AI Tools

## 6. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Leadership Perspective
**Quote**: "Speed is our core value and moat. Developer productivity is therefore a business strategy: the faster we turn ideas into reliable products, the stronger our competitive position."
- **Speaker**: Tran Ba Vinh Son, Group Company CTO and MEPAR Manager
- **Key Insight**: AI assistance is strategic competitive advantage, not just productivity tool

### Vision for AI-Assisted Development
- **Planning**: AI as teammate in planning phase
- **Implementation**: AI handles implementation with human direction
- **Testing**: AI-assisted test generation and validation
- **Operations**: AI for SRE operations and multilingual code explanations

### Future Expansion Plans
- **Product Discovery**: AI assistance in feature planning
- **Test Generation**: Automated test creation
- **SRE Operations**: AI for site reliability engineering
- **Multilingual Support**: Code explanations for distributed teams
