## 3. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES

### Dramatic Efficiency Gains
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| CSR Writing Time | Multi-month cycle | 90% reduction | Months → minutes |
| Patient Guide Creation | Months | Under 1 minute | 99%+ reduction |
| CSR Production Rate | 2.3 CSRs/year per writer | Automated | Unlimited capacity |
| Documentation Team | 50 people | Single users | 98%+ reduction |

### Quality and Regulatory Impact
- **Positive Regulator Feedback**: Automated documents consistently receive positive feedback
- **Review Cycle Reduction**: Review-to-approval cycles significantly decreased
- **Clinical Interpretation**: High-quality analysis and overall output satisfaction
- **Industry First**: First pharmaceutical company to generate complete CSR in minutes using GenAI

## 4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Built with Claude Code
**Quote**: "Claude Code lets us do experiments easily, make decisions fast, and iterate quickly to get products out."
- **Developer**: Waheed Jowiya, Digitalization Strategy Director
- **Team Size**: 11 people (small, agile team)
- **Development Time**: Record time from idea to approval
- **Background**: Jowiya has PhD in molecular biology but limited programming experience

### Non-Technical Empowerment
**Quote**: "It allows our scientific domain experts, people like myself and my director Louise, to have a much bigger impact on how things are developed."
- **Impact**: Non-technical team members can prototype ideas
- **Process**: Natural language → POC in hours (vs days/weeks)
- **Strategic Value**: Any team member can be a product developer

### Technical Setup Variations
- **Patient Booklets**: Minimal RAG configuration time
- **Device Protocols**: Several months to ingest unstructured legacy data
- **Security Focus**: Secure usage in highly regulated environment

## 5. EXPANDED APPLICATIONS

### Beyond Clinical Trials
- **Device Testing Documentation**: Automated verification protocols
- **Patient Materials**: Consumer-friendly treatment guides
- **Medical Affairs**: Pilots underway
- **Data Extraction**: Solving biggest headache - extracting data from historical research documents

### Future Development Plans
1. **Common Technical Documents (CTDs)**: Automating entire regulatory submission process
2. **Data Analysis**: Extracting deeper insights from clinical trials
3. **Data Infrastructure Modernization**: AI-assisted infrastructure updates

---

## 6. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Leadership Perspective
**Quote**: "We've consistently been one of the first movers when it comes to document and content automation in pharma development. Our work with Anthropic and Claude has set a new standard — we're not just automating tasks, we're transforming how medicines get from discovery to the patients who need them."
- **Speaker**: Louise Lind Skov, Director Content Digitalisation
- **Key Insight**: AI is transforming entire drug development pipeline, not just automating tasks

### Competitive Positioning
- **First Mover Advantage**: Industry-first automated CSR generation
- **New Standard**: Setting benchmarks for pharmaceutical AI adoption
- **Strategic Partnership**: Collaboration with Anthropic guided secure implementation

### Security and Compliance
**Quote**: "In a highly regulated industry, we can't just throw our data and information into a large language model and hope for the best."
- **Approach**: Guided by Anthropic on secure usage for planning, strategy, code generation
- **Focus**: Regulatory-grade content with compliance requirements
