### Key Teaching Principles Discovered

1. **Start with Plans Before Execution**
   - Emphasize planning over immediate coding
   - Teach spec-driven development patterns
   - Use plan mode for exploration

2. **Manage Context Effectively**
   - Teach context window limitations
   - Show compaction strategies
   - Demonstrate CLAUDE.md usage

3. **Customize Workflows**
   - No one-size-fits-all approach
   - Encourage personal skill development
   - Build custom hooks and automations

4. **Review Generated Code**
   - Never trust AI output blindly
   - Teach code review patterns
   - Verify against specifications

5. **Break Down Projects**
   - Task decomposition skills
   - Incremental development
   - Iterative refinement

## 3. WORKSHOP DESIGN PATTERNS

### Effective Structure Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Four-Phase Workflow
Based on AgenticCoding.ai methodology:

```
Phase 1: Understand & Plan
- Define problem clearly
- Research existing solutions
- Create specification

Phase 2: Design & Architecture
- Design solution approach
- Plan implementation steps
- Identify trade-offs

Phase 3: Implement & Iterate
- Incremental implementation
- Continuous testing
- Refine based on feedback

Phase 4: Review & Validate
- Verify against spec
- Test thoroughly
- Document decisions
```

#### Pattern 2: Progressive Skill Building
From Reddit community best practices:

```
Level 1: Foundation (Beginner)
- Basic tool usage
- Simple prompt engineering
- Single-file tasks

Level 2: Integration (Intermediate)
- Multi-file coordination
- Context management
- Custom skills

Level 3: Orchestration (Advanced)
- Multiagent systems
- Complex workflows
- Production deployment
```

#### Pattern 3: Situational Awareness
From Kevin Kern's workshop approach:

```
Decision Framework:
├─ CLI Tools → Batch operations, automation
├─ IDE Integration → Real-time assistance
├─ Code Editors → Quick prototypes
└─ Browser Agents → Research, documentation

Teach participants to choose the right tool for each situation.
```
